# Hot Wire

A fun little browser game. 

Move the mouse from the green field to the red one without touching any black walls.

Timer starts as soon as you touch the green area with your cursor. It stops when hitting a wall or reaching the goal (red field). When you hit a wall the timer is stopped and you need to move back to the green field to re-start it.

⚠️ Only works with mouse, touch is not supported.
